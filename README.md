### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Rob Berry, a creative technologist in the environmental risk sector. My expertise in software, data and systems development helps tackle complex numerical and data challenges, empowering informed decision-making. I particularly enjoy projects which require:

- advanced data (especially geospatial) analysis;
- high-performance processing (CPU and GPU); 
- process optimisation; and
- system and architecture design.

### Contact me ðŸ’¬

I can be found in a few places on the web. Reach me on Twitter [@robberry](https://twitter.com/robberry) or visit [robberry.net](https://robberry.net). [Linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/robberry) continues to be the place I document my career moves.
