### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob Berry, a creative developer of technology for engineers.  I work on software and systems which solve complex numerical and data problems, typically in the areas of flood risk or environmental management.  I particularly enjoy projects which require:

- advanced data (especially geospatial) analysis;
- high-performance processing (CPU and GPU); 
- process optimisation; and
- system and architecture design.

### Contact me ðŸ’¬

I can be found in a few places on the web. Reach me on Twitter [@robberry](https://twitter.com/robberry) or email me. [Linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/robberry) continues to be the place I document my career moves.
